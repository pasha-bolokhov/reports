       This manuscript addresses the issue of locality in a
Lorentz-violating theory of a scalar field. The procedure of canonical
quantization is performed on such a theory to show that the canonical
commutation relations are not compatible with the principle of
microcausality. According to the paper, this problem can
be avoided if the space-time is assumed to have a latticized structure.
       While it is agreeable that this theory has difficulties with
the microcausality principle, it does not seem acceptable that the
refusal of continuum of the space-time is the proper approach to
make the theory regular. The problem of locality of the given theory,
as lighted in the paper, rather seems to be the problem of the
particular variation of the canonical quantization technique used
by the authors. While on general grounds such a theory, similar to other
theories with modified dispersion relations, is not expected to be
flawless upon quantization, it is hard to believe that this would lead
to the consequences as bad (in the phenomenological sense) as the
lattice-like structure of the space-time. Since the discretization of
the space-time constitutes the main statement of the paper, we do
not recommend this paper for publication in its present form.
